Welcome!

I am a PhD candidate in Strategy and Entrepreneurship at the Leeds School of Business, University of Colorado Boulder. Previously, I earned an MA in Economics from Duke University and a BSc in Economics from Sun Yat-sen University and the University of Birmingham.


My research resides at the intersection of technology and corporate strategy. My current work focuses on the strategic utilization of user communities, digital platforms, and automation technologies for value creation and appropriation. The first aspect of my work delves into the governance strategies that firms can employ to shape the behaviors of participants or complementors within open-source communities and digital platforms. The second stream of my research attempts to understand how the adoption of automation/AI technologies can influence the knowledge production process.
